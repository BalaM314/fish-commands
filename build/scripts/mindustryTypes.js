Mindustry is written in Java, which has strong types.
Mindustry supports loading Javascript, which does not have types.
Javascript will have access to Mindustry's functions, which have types.
We are writing Typescript, which does have types. We are able to call Mindustry's functions, but because those are written in Java we cannot directly use those types.
This file contains some of those type definitions, ported over from the Java definitions.
